abstract: |
  A detailed electrochemical and computational investigation was conducted to evaluate the corrosion inhibition performance of epicatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural catechin extracted from green tea leaves, on 1018 carbon steel in 1 M H₂SO₄. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization, and gravimetric techniques confirmed that EGCG acts as a mixed-type inhibitor forming a stable and adherent protective film on the metal surface. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided insights into adsorption mechanisms and interaction energies, showing strong correlation with experimental inhibition efficiencies.

summary: |
  EGCG from green tea exhibits excellent corrosion-inhibition efficiency for carbon steel in acidic medium, combining experimental and DFT/MD results.
